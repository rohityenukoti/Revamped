# Free Cases Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the "Free Cases" section in the BrainBank. This feature allows displaying cases marked with `FreeCase: true` in the CMS in a separate section at the top of the tree view, organized by topic, category, and subcategory just like regular cases.

## Files Modified

### 1. PatientGPT/pageCodeV2.js

#### New Functions Added:
- `fetchFreeCasesStructure()`: Fetches cases marked as free from the BrainBank collection and organizes them into the same hierarchical structure as regular cases.

#### Modified Functions:
- `loadTreeViewData()`: Updated to fetch free cases and create a "ðŸ†“ Free Cases" section at the top of the tree if any free cases exist.
- `findCasePath()`: Updated to check both free cases structure and regular cases structure when finding the path for case highlighting.

#### Key Changes:
1. Free cases are fetched separately using `wixData.query("BrainBank").eq("FreeCase", true)`
2. Free cases are organized into topics using the same logic as regular cases
3. A new tree section "ðŸ†“ Free Cases" is added at the top when free cases exist
4. Free cases use a special ID prefix `FreeCases_` to distinguish them in the tree
5. Case highlighting works for both free and regular cases

### 2. PatientGPT/combined.html

#### Modified Functions:
- `isItemHighlighted()`: Updated to handle the new `freeSection` type and properly highlight free cases using the modified ID structure.

#### New CSS Styles Added:
- Green color scheme for free cases section to distinguish it visually
- Special styling for:
  - Main "ðŸ†“ Free Cases" header (bright green)
  - Free cases topics (lighter green)
  - Free cases items (light green background with green left border)
  - Highlighted states (darker green variants)

## How It Works

1. **Data Fetching**: When the tree view loads, two separate queries are made:
   - Regular cases: `fetchTreeStructure()`
   - Free cases: `fetchFreeCasesStructure()`

2. **Tree Structure**: If free cases exist, the tree structure becomes:
   ```
   ðŸ†“ Free Cases
   â”œâ”€â”€ Topic 1 (FreeCases_Topic1)
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Category A
   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Case X
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Case Y
   â””â”€â”€ Topic 2 (FreeCases_Topic2)
       â””â”€â”€ Case Z
   Regular Topic 1
   â”œâ”€â”€ Category A
   â””â”€â”€ Case A
   Regular Topic 2
   ...
   ```

3. **Access Control**: Free cases bypass the normal subscription check and are accessible to all users regardless of their plan.

4. **Case Path Finding**: When a case is selected, the system:
   - First checks if it's in the free cases structure
   - If not found, checks the regular cases structure
   - Returns the appropriate path for highlighting

5. **Visual Distinction**: Free cases use a green color scheme throughout the tree to clearly indicate they are free content.

## Database Requirements

The implementation expects a `FreeCase` boolean field in the BrainBank collection. Cases marked with `FreeCase: true` will appear in the free cases section.

## Benefits

1. **Clear Organization**: Free cases are clearly separated and visually distinct
2. **Consistent Structure**: Free cases maintain the same topic/category/subcategory organization
3. **Easy Access**: Free cases are prominently displayed at the top
4. **No Code Duplication**: Reuses existing tree rendering and case loading logic
5. **Scalable**: Can handle any number of free cases across any topics
